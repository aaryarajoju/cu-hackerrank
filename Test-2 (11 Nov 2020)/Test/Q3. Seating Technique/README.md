## 3. Seating Technique

Munna and Kaleen are quite fond of travelling. They mostly travel by railways. They were travelling in a train one day and they got interested in the seating arrangement of their compartment. The compartment looked something like-<br>

<br>
So they got interested to know the seat number facing them and the seat type facing them. The seats are denoted as follows:
<ul>
<li>Window Seat : <b>WS</b></li>
<li>Middle Seat : <b>MS</b></li>
<li>Aisle Seat : <b>AS</b></li>
</ul>
<br>
You will be given a seat number, find the seat number facing you and the seat type, i.e. <b>WS</b>, <b>MS</b> or <b>AS</b>.<br>
<br>
<b>Input:</b><br>
The first line of input will consist of a single integer <b>T</b> denoting number of test-cases. Each test-case consists of a single integer <b>N</b> denoting the seat-number.<br>
<br>
<b>Output:</b><br>
For each test case, print the facing seat-number and the seat type, separated by a single space in a new line.<br>
<br>
<b>Constraints:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>1 <= <b>T</b> <= 10^5</li>
<li>1 <= <b>N</b> <= 108</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
Sample Input:<br>
```
2
18
40
```
<br>
<br>
Sample Output:<br>
```
19 WS
45 AS
```
<br>
<p>Explanation: 2 denotes the number of test cases. 18 is the first seat number and 19 is in front of it and is a Window Seat (WS). Similarly, 40 is the second input and the seat opposite to it is 45 and is an Aisle Seat (AS).</p>
